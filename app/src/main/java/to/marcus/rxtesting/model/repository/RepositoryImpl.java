 * Inject our model (database, json list)
 * use a repository interface (observable get methods)
 *      these will require an observable to obtain data from any source (database OR network pull)
 *
 *    then inject the repository into the presenter? or into another class (getcharacterinfousecase).
 *      the presenter also has a parserTest injection
